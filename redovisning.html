<h2>Kmom01</h2>
<p>-It was fun to make a website and its great that we have the option to publish it to dbwebb to acess it or share it to anyone :))
-I have never worked with databases before except excel.
-The work we did from the SQL guide took some time to understand and to setup but once I got going it was easy. 
MySQL workbench has some bugs where it says there are syntax errors or other errors and it wont run the code so thats annoying, 
but from the ununtu terminal it runs as it should at least. So we have to write the code in Workbench and run it from UwUntu.
-I liked the syntax of SQL, its similar to python in some ways and very intuitive if you have a code editor that actually works :)).
 I still preffer python or excel for now since we are working with small amounts of data but I can see how it will be increasingly useful as 
 we work with larger amounts of data.
 -Today I Learned more SQL syntax which was quite nice and intuitive, learned that sometimes it IS the computers fault (Workbench giving errors when it shouldnt)
  and that taking a break to take a walk can solve a lot of unsolvable programming problmes :)).

<h2>Kmom03</h2>
<p>
In the Kmom03 assignment, I continued to deepen my understanding of databases and SQL. I focused on advanced querying techniques and learned how to use JOIN statements to combine data from multiple tables.

I explored different types of JOINs, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN, and learned how to specify join conditions to retrieve the desired data. I also practiced using aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, and GROUP BY to perform calculations on grouped data.

Furthermore, I delved into the concept of database normalization and learned about the different normal forms. I applied these principles to restructure and optimize the database schema, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy.

Throughout the assignment, I worked with the provided files in the KMOM03 folder. I analyzed the existing database structure, made necessary modifications, and executed SQL statements to retrieve specific data based on given requirements.

The Terminal2/ index.js is the main entry point for a terminal-based application. It sets up a menu system and handles user input to perform various actions, such as displaying data from a database and making changes to it. The program uses the readline-promise library for handling user input and the helpers module for interacting with the database.

Overall, the Kmom03 assignment was a valuable learning experience that expanded my knowledge of databases and SQL. I gained proficiency in advanced querying techniques and database optimization, which will be crucial in handling complex data scenarios in the future.

<h2>Kmom05</h2>
<p>In the Kmom05 project, I had the opportunity to work on the first part of an e-shop application. 
    This involved creating a visually appealing website where users can add and remove products from a database.
    I had trouble making sure that the CSS is actually working and that the website looks good, the CSS refuses to load 
    but this is fixed in KMOM06.
    Additionally, I implemented a terminal version of the program to provide an alternative interface for users.

    Throughout the project, I focused on integrating the front-end and back-end components of the application. 
    I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and develop the website.
     I leveraged the power of SQL to interact with the database, allowing users to perform actions such as adding products
      and removing them.
    
    One of the highlights of the project was implementing the functionality to display the products dynamically 
    on the website. This involved retrieving data from the database and dynamically generating HTML content to 
    showcase the products.
    
    In addition to the website, I created a terminal version of the program. This allowed users to interact with 
    the e-shop application through a command-line interface. Users could perform the same actions as on the website, 
    such as adding and removing products, but with the convenience of a text-based interface.
    
    Overall, completing the Kmom05 project was a rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of HTML,
     CSS, JavaScript, and SQL to create a functional e-shop application. I gained valuable insights into front-end 
     and back-end integration, as well as user interface design. The project also provided an opportunity to enhance
      my skills in database management and query execution.</p>

<h2>Kmom07-10</h2> 
<p># Redovisning f√∂r try1-projektet </p><p>

    I have been working on the try1 folder, specifically on building a database using SQL.  
    The goal of this project was to create a robust and efficient database to store and manage data. </p><p>
    
    To begin with, I designed the database schema, carefully considering the relationships  
    between different entities and the data types for each attribute. I used SQL statements  
    to create the necessary tables, specifying the primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. </p><p>
    
    Next, I populated the database with relevant data. I wrote SQL insert statements to add  
    records to the tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency. </p><p>
    
    To query the database, I utilized SQL select statements. I retrieved specific data based  
    on various conditions, such as filtering by certain criteria or joining multiple tables together to extract meaningful insights. </p><p>
    
    The try1 project/exam involved building a robust and efficient database using SQL whcih can be accessed
    and manipulated through the web app or the terminal client. I gained 
    valuable experience in database design, data manipulation, and query optimization. This project 
    has enhanced my understanding of database management and SQL programming.</p><p>
    
    Overall, the exam was challenging but manageable. It required careful consideration of the relationships 
    between entities and the data types for each attribute. The process of designing the database schema and 
    writing SQL statements took some time and effort. However, with proper planning and understanding of SQL 
    concepts, it was possible to complete the exam successfully. The exam provided a good opportunity to apply 
    the knowledge gained throughout the course and test database design and SQL programming skills. It was a 
    reasonable examination that effectively assessed the understanding and proficiency in database management
    and practicing on previous exams certainly helped a lot.</p><p>
    
    
    
    For each project requirement implemented in the try1 project, I carefully planned and executed the necessary 
    steps to ensure a successful outcome.</p><p>
    
    Requirement 1: Building a robust and efficient database using SQL
    To fulfill this requirement, I started by designing the database schema. I analyzed the data and identified 
    the entities and their relationships. I then created the necessary tables using SQL statements, specifying 
    primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. This process required attention to detail and a deep understanding 
    of database design principles. I also reverse engineered the sql file to get a er diagram, a simple way to solve 
    another requirement. I encountered some challenges in normalizing the data and ensuring data integrity, 
    but with careful consideration and testing, I was able to overcome these obstacles.</p><p>
    </p><p>
    Requirement 2: Implementing a search function
    To meet this requirement, I leveraged my SQL skills to create a search function that allows users to query the 
    database for specific information. I used SQL select statements with appropriate conditions and joins to retrieve 
    the desired data. I also kept in mind that when searching I should NOT search in the developer table, but I should still display it.
    I made a procedure in SQL that I call in a function in the exam.js file where all the functions are added.
    I have a procedure for the web and another for the cli.js.
    This task was relatively straightforward, as I had prior experience with SQL queries and knew how to structure them effectively.</p><p>
    
    Requirement 3: Implementing a report function
    To fulfill this requirement, from what I understood, I took the table as it was wanted and printed it when it was required.
    Had some eslint errors because it was more then 100 characters per line so i split it, might look a bit weired but all the info is there.
    In retrospect, I probably should have parsed the data and loaded it into a sql database then selected the data with sql code and printed it,
    not just making it a comment and printing it as is, but that ship has sailed.</p><p>

    Regarding the course, I found it to be highly informative and well-structured. The material provided a comprehensive 
    overview of database management concepts and SQL programming. The guidance and support from the teachers were 
    excellent, especially in the beginning when setting up the environemnts to program and with prompt responses to queries 
    and helpful feedback on assignments. The course exercises and projects 
    were challenging yet rewarding, allowing me to apply the knowledge gained and develop practical skills. </p><p>

    In terms of improvement suggestions, it would be beneficial to include more hands-on exercises and real-world 
    examples to further reinforce the concepts taught. Having more of the lessons in person would also help a lot, it felt
    at times as though i was just following a long youtube tutorial. Additionally, providing more detailed explanations and 
    step-by-step instructions for complex topics would be helpful for beginners. Overall, I am satisfied with the 
    course and would highly recommend it to my friends and colleagues who are interested in learning about database 
    management and SQL programming.</p><p>

    On a scale of 1-10, I would give this course a solid 8. It provided a solid foundation in database management 
    and SQL programming, and the course material was well-presented and engaging although mostly online an not in person. 
    The guidance and support from the teachers was much appreciated, and the practical projects allowed for the application 
    of learned concepts. I am confident that the knowledge and skills gained from this course will be valuable in my future 
    endeavors in software development.</p><p>
